    "## Simple Arrays\n",
    "One of the most fundamental data structures in any language is the array. Python doesn't have a native array data structure, but it has the list which is much more general and can be used as a multidimensional array quite easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### List Basics\n",
    "<p>A list in Python is just an ordered collection of items which can be of any type. By comparison an array is an ordered collection of items of a single type - so in principle a list is more flexible than an array but it is this flexibility that makes things slightly harder when you want to work with a regular structure. A list is also a dynamic mutable type and this means you can add and delete elements from the list at any time.\n",
    "<p/>\n",
    "To define a list you simply write a comma separated list of items in square brackets:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myList=[1,2,3,4,5,6]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This looks like an array because you can use \"slicing\" notation to pick out an individual element - indexes start from 0. For example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print myList[2]\n",

    "<p>So far so good, and it looks as if using a list is as easy as using an array. The first thing that we tend to need to do is to scan through an array and examine values. For example, to find the maximum value (forgetting for a moment that there is a built-in max function)  you could use:\n",
